Function that takes in 2 Doubles and returns an Int
Must call previous function for parameters
    The doubles are multiplied and the rounded result is returned.
Decimals of .0-.4 are rounded down. .5-.9 are rounded up.
Should print the values that were passed into it and the rounded result as an Int before returning.
Call the function
Function takes in an Array of multiple Strings
Function should implement the following behavior:
Must use a Switch Statement for logic
    If 1-3 Strings passed in
Reverse each string in the Array, then print the Array
["zebra", "JAGUAR", "apple"] becomes ["arbez", "RAUGAJ", "elppa"]
If 4-6
Reverse the element order in the Array, then print the Array
["zebra", "JAGUAR", "apple", "Blue", "eMerald"] becomes ["eMerald", "Blue", "apple", "JAGUAR", "zebra"]
If >6
Prints strings in alphabetical order. (Print Strings, not the Array)
Due to the way Unicode characters work, you must cast the entire string you're comparing to either all uppercase or all lowercase. The choice is yours, but you must do that same to everything.
Call this function according to the following:
Create a String Array of these 3 elements: ["zebra", "JAGUAR", "apple"]
Call function passing in the Array
Append these 2 elements to the Array: ["Blue", "eMerald"]
Call function passing in the Array
Append these 2 elements to the Array: ["beads", "BEAR"]
Call function passing in the Array
Function takes in Large String from randomtextgenerator.com returns Tuple(numVowels, numConsonants)
Copy and paste the entire first paragraph from the website into a string variable, and pass the variable into this function.
Count the number of words that start with consonants/vowels
Return the Tuple and print the result of the function call. (Does not print in the function)
We're not counting characters, only first character of each word. Do not count spaces as either type
